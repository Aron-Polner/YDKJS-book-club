### General info

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. I've added the first parts of the first five solitions I wrote. They are by no means perfect but they contain valid JS.

### Runing the code

With NodeJS installed and standing in the folder you want to run code from type:

```javascript
node 1.js
```

That will run the code once. If you'd rather run the code with a watcher you can use nodemon. To do so type:

```javascript
nodemon 1.js
```

nodemon needs to be installed to work. That can be done via this command:

```
npm install --global nodemon
```

You can read more about nodemon [here](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
